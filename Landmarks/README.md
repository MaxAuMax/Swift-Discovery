# Landmarks

This is the first app i made in SwiftUI. I was following Apple's Guide "SwiftUI Tutorials".

This app is available on IOS / WatchOS / MacOS (not on the App Store, only with Virtual Device).
It's goal is to give you a list of different places in the USA to visit such as Turtle Rock, Lake McDonald, etc.
